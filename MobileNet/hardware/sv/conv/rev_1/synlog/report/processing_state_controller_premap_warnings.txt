@W: MT529 :"/home/ted4152/Spring24/Facepga/MobileNet/hardware/sv/other_layers/resizer.sv":118:0:118:8|Found inferred clock resizer|clock which controls 27 sequential elements including state_s[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
