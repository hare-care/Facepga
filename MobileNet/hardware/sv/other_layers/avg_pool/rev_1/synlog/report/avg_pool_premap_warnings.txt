@W: MT529 :"/home/ted4152/Spring24/Facepga/MobileNet/hardware/sv/other_layers/avg_pool/div_synth.sv":60:0:60:8|Found inferred clock avg_pool|clock which controls 175 sequential elements including divider.msb_a[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
