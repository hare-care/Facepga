@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
@N: FA174 |The following device usage report estimates place and route data. Please look at the place and route report for final resource usage.
